HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

I wanted to create a simple management system in C# with Windows Forms, so I decided to create this Hospital Management System. 
This project is simple and I plan to add more functionality later on, but I wanted to go ahead and put this on github for anyone to see.

AS OF 11/2/2020: 

This application organizes the registration of patients into the hospital and it keeps track of current staff working at the hospital. 
I imagined this would be used by a secretary or other front desk worker, so I designed it as such. My goal for this project was to create an interface that is easy to understand
and easy to navigate. I hosted a local database with SQL Express for the patient and staff information. There is a really helpful library that I imported for this
project (fontawesome.sharp) for those interested in designing cleaner user interfaces, and I felt as though I should give credit where it is due. If you go to 
https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery then you will see information for a truly innovative library of free icons. I found it to be easy to use, and I would recommend it to anyone else.

POSSIBLE UPCOMING ADDITIONS:

- Add a room tracking feature to let the user know if a room is full when registering a patient into the system.
- Doctors will be able to schedule certain tests/labs to be ran on a patient.
- Add the ability to view a doctors expected schedule throughout the day, to make planning easier.
- Create a smaller inventory management system so I could add a medicine store to this application.

Closing remarks/thoughts: 

This was a really fun project for me, and it helped me knock some rust off since graduating college. 
One of my biggest challenges was deciding on a user interface that looks modern and practical. I feel with enough practice, I will get better at designing user interfaces.
But for now this is what I have and I feel proud of it.
